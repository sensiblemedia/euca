Welcome to Eucalyptus!  Here are a few commands to help you get familiar with your new cloud.

First, source your new credentials. You must load your credentials to interact with Eucalyptus.
Run the following command to source credentials:
  
  source ~/eucarc

Next, take a look at your available cloud images.  We've already registered an image for you,
so you should see one image listed. Run the following command to see your available images:

  euca-describe-images

Next, install your own image. Many Linux distributions now have preconfigured cloud images,
so you can download and install them to your cloud easily.  Run the following commands
to add a Fedora 20 cloud image to your Eucalyptus install.

  # Download the image
  curl http://mirror.fdcservers.net/fedora/updates/20/Images/x86_64/Fedora-x86_64-20-20140407-sda.raw.xz > fedora.raw.xz

  # Unzip the image.
  xz -d fedora.raw.xz 

  # Install the image.
  euca-install-image -n Fedora20 -b fedora -i fedora.raw -r x86_64 --virtualization-type hvm

  # Set the image to be available to all users.
  euca-modify-image-attribute -l -a all $(euca-describe-images | grep fedora | grep emi | cut -f 2)

  # Finally, run an instance based on the new image.
  euca-run-instances -k my-first-keypair $(euca-describe-images | grep fedora | grep emi | cut -f 2)

  # Run euca-describe-instances to get information about your instances.
  euca-describe-instances

  # Once your instance is listed as "running", ssh to it. Don't forget to specify the right keypair!
  ssh -i ~/my-first-keypair.pem 192.168.1.101 (or whatever the IP of your instance is)
